Text-to-Speech (TTS) Demo
This project demonstrates how to implement Text-to-Speech (TTS) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. TTS allows written text to be converted into spoken words, making content more accessible and interactive.

Features:
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts typed text into spoken words using the browserâ€™s SpeechSynthesis API.
Customizable Voice Selection: Choose from available voices, languages, and accents.
Simple User Interface: Easy-to-use interface with a text input, a speak button, and a voice selection dropdown.
How It Works:
Type text into the provided text box.
Select a voice and click the "Speak" button to hear the text read aloud.
The app uses the SpeechSynthesis API to convert text into speech in real time.
Technologies Used:
HTML for structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript for functionality
