A custom menu is an important part of navigation on a website or app. It's designed to fit the look and needs of the site or app. A custom menu makes it easier for users to find and move between different parts of the site. You can customize how it looks and works, like adding features that let the menu open or close, show extra options when you hover, or expand to show more choices. This helps users navigate the site easily while keeping it looking good and easy to use.
